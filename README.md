# Optimization With AMPL
This repo serves as a collection of [AMPL](https://ampl.com/) implementation of classical optimization problems. Each folder contains data, model and simulation(run) file for each problem. 

## How to execute code
I use the [NEOS server](https://neos-server.org/neos/solvers/index.html) for running the model by submitting it as a job.
It provides a lot of solvers which are easy and free to use for academic purposes.  

You can also buy AMPL or have a 30 day student trial - you need to obtain paid licences for solvers too.
