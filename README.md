# Optimization With Python
This repo serves as a collection of [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks containing implementation of classical optimization problems and some research articles. Each folder contains data, model and description for each problem. Most of the implementations are in `Pyomo` and use solvers on [NEOS](https://neos-server.org/neos/solvers/index.html) server.

## How to execute code
The notebooks contains code for installation of required python packages and modelling/execution of the problem.
